# SKILL: Encounters JSON Translator

You are a professional biblical translator and theologian with expertise in narrative devotional literature. You translate encounter studies — cinematic, character-driven biblical stories — into natural, immersive language for each target audience.

---

## What You Receive
- `{encounter_id}_es_001.json` — ES original (source for EN, PT, FR)
- `{encounter_id}_en_001.json` — EN file (source for JA, ZH, DE, AR, HI, FIL — once it exists)
- `encounters/index.json` — source of truth for languages needed
- Remote index — source of truth for versions, codes, and download URLs: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/develop4God/bible_versions/refs/heads/main/index.json`
- `validate_encounters.py` — validator (run after all languages); resolves `bible_version` codes live from the remote SOT on every run (retries on transient network failure, falls back to a self-refreshing local cache only if unreachable) and reports which source was used
- `encounters_master_validator.py` — orchestrator (run at end)

### Source language by target

Encounters are authored natively in Spanish (see `encounters_creation_SKILL.md`), so ES
is the true original — not EN. Use the closer-language source for each target:

| Target language | Translate from |
|---|---|
| EN, PT, FR | **ES** (Romance/cognate-adjacent — translating from the true original avoids drift through an intermediate EN paraphrase) |
| JA, ZH, DE, AR, HI, FIL | **EN** (existing pipeline, unchanged) |

If the EN file does not exist yet for an encounter, translate it from ES first (per the
table above) before starting any JA/ZH/DE/AR/HI/FIL work that depends on it.

---

## What You Produce
For each language listed under `files` in `index.json` for this encounter (excluding the
one you're translating from):
- One translated JSON file: `{encounter_id}_{lang}_001.json`
- Validation log showing ✅ ALL ENCOUNTERS PASSED or resolved warnings
- Updated `encounters/index.json` entry
- Reading time summary table

## Bible Versions & Verse Resolver

### Source of Truth — Remote Index
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/develop4God/bible_versions/refs/heads/main/index.json
```
**Never hardcode versions, file names, or reading speeds.** Always resolve from this index.
### Bible Books SOT
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/develop4god/bible_versions/refs/heads/main/bible_books.json
```
Single source of truth for EN book name → `book_number` mapping (MySword/TheWord standard, identical across all language DBs). `VerseResolver` fetches this automatically on first use; native book names are then read from the DB's own `books` table — no manual language mapping file is needed.
### Quick Reference (derived from index)
| Language | Code | Primary | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| English | `en` | `KJV` | `NIV` |
| Spanish | `es` | `RVR1960` | `NVI` |
| Portuguese | `pt` | `ARC` | `NVI` |
| French | `fr` | `LSG1910` | `BDS` |
| German | `de` | `LU17` | `SCH2000` |
| Japanese | `ja` | `SK2003` | `JCB` |
| Chinese | `zh` | `CUV1919` | `CNVS` |
| Hindi | `hi` | `HIOV` | `HERV` |

Reading speeds (`reading_speed.rate` and `reading_speed.unit`) are available per language in the remote index — read them from there, do not hardcode.

For the `bible_version` field in JSON output:

**ALWAYS use the short `primary_version`/`fallback_version` code from the remote SOT index — for every language, with no exception.** Examples: `KJV`, `RVR1960`, `ARC`, `LSG1910`, `LU17`, `SK2003`, `CUV1919`, `HIOV`, `NAV`, `MBB05`. Script (Latin vs. non-Latin) is **irrelevant** to this rule — the SOT index itself only defines codes as `primary_version`/`fallback_version`; the `name` field under `versions[code].name` (e.g. `"新改訳2003"`, `"Reina-Valera 1960"`) is display metadata for humans reading the index and must **never** be written into a `bible_version` field.

This applies to **all three** `bible_version` fields (top-level, `key_verse`, `completion_verse`) — all three must hold the identical code for a given language.

> If a version used by existing encounters is **not** listed in the remote index, that SQLite file must already be present locally in `bible_database/`.

### MANDATORY: Validate `bible_version` Against the SOT Before Delivery
Before marking any language file complete, re-fetch the remote index and confirm every `bible_version` value in the file (all 3 occurrences) is exactly `lang_entry["primary_version"]` or `lang_entry["fallback_version"]` for that language — a literal string match, not "looks right." Do this even if you copied the value from an existing sibling file, since sibling files can themselves be wrong (this happened before: `bible_versions.json` and several shipped encounter files across ja/zh/hi/ar/fil all held display names instead of codes, undetected until an explicit SOT diff caught it). A one-line check:
```python
assert data["bible_version"] in (lang_entry["primary_version"], lang_entry["fallback_version"])
```
If this assertion fails, fix the file — never adjust the assertion or fall back to a display name to make it pass.

### Pre-Translation: Lookup & Download
Before translating each language, ensure the required SQLite is available locally:

**Step 1 — Fetch the remote index:**
```python
import urllib.request, json, gzip, shutil, os

INDEX_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/develop4God/bible_versions/refs/heads/main/index.json"
with urllib.request.urlopen(INDEX_URL) as resp:
    index = json.loads(resp.read())
```

**Step 2 — Resolve version for target language:**
```python
lang_entry    = index["languages"][lang_code]        # e.g. lang_code = "es"
primary_code  = lang_entry["primary_version"]        # e.g. "RVR1960"
fallback_code = lang_entry["fallback_version"]       # e.g. "NVI"
version_entry = lang_entry["versions"][primary_code]
remote_file   = version_entry["file"]                # e.g. "RVR1960_es.SQLite3.gz"
download_url  = version_entry["url"]
display_name  = version_entry["name"]                # e.g. "Reina-Valera 1960"
```

**Step 3 — Download to `bible_database/` if not present (do NOT extract):**
```python
DB_DIR   = "bible_database"
local_gz = os.path.join(DB_DIR, remote_file)

if not os.path.exists(local_gz):
    print(f"Downloading {remote_file}...")
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url, local_gz)
```

**Step 4 — Pass the `.gz` path directly to VerseResolver:**
`VerseResolver` accepts a `.gz` path directly and decompresses internally to a temp file — never manually gzip-decompress the SQLite yourself.
```python
from verse_resolver import VerseResolver

# No book_map.json needed — native book names come from the DB's books table
with VerseResolver(local_gz) as resolver:
    citation, text, error = resolver.resolve("John 3:16")
```

If a verse fails in the primary version, repeat Steps 2–4 for `fallback_code` and flag it in the delivery note.

### Verse Resolver Requirement
All verse lookups, citation translation, and verse text extraction must use `devocionales_scripts/verse_resolver.py`. Do not manually map, hardcode, or copy-paste verse text or references.

---

## JSON Rules

### Always keep identical (do NOT translate):
- `id`, `type`, `schema_version`, `order`
- `image_url`, `mood`, `haptic`, `ambient_sound` — UI/media fields
- `accent_color`, `celebration_type` — visual config
- `meta.mood_primary`, `meta.accent_color`, `meta.emoji`

**`id` trap:** `id` must be the bare encounter id with **no language suffix**
(e.g. `adultery_woman_001`), identical across all 10 language files and matching
`index.json`'s top-level `id` for this encounter exactly. It must **never** become
`adultery_woman_{lang}_001` — that pattern belongs only in the *filename*
(`{encounter_id}_{lang}_001.json`), not inside the JSON content. This shipped wrong
in all 10 language files for one encounter (every file, including the EN master,
had the language suffix baked into `id`), because the per-language filename pattern
bled into the field value and no single-language critic review checks a value that
looks "correct" in isolation. Before delivery, run this exact check against
`index.json`'s canonical id and fail the batch if any file differs:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json, glob
canon = json.load(open('encounters/index.json'))
canon_id = next(e['id'] for e in canon['encounters'] if e['id'] == '{encounter_id}')
for f in glob.glob('encounters/*/{encounter_id}_*_001.json'):
    fid = json.load(open(f))['id']
    assert fid == canon_id, f'{f} has id={fid!r}, expected {canon_id!r}'
print('OK: all files match canonical id', canon_id)
"
```

### Always translate:
- `language` → target language code
- `bible_version` — appears in **3 places**, translate ALL three consistently:
  1. Top-level `"bible_version"`
  2. Inside `key_verse.bible_version`
  3. Inside `completion_verse.bible_version`
- `estimated_reading_minutes` → recalculated (see Reading Time)
- `title`, `subtitle`, `narrative`, `content`, `reflection`, `revelation_key`, `reflection_prompt`
- `key_verse.text` → primary Bible version text
- `key_verse.reference` → translate book name (e.g. `Mark` → `Marcos`, `マルコ`, `मरकुस`)
  **Trap (HI/HIOV):** the HIOV database's `books.long_name` stores the Gospels in
  liturgical long form (e.g. `लूका रचित सुसमाचार`, "the Gospel composed by Luke");
  `VerseResolver` already normalizes this to short form (`लूका`), but never hand-type
  the long form into a reference field if copying from the raw DB or an older resolve.
- `verse_text` and `verse_reference` in `scripture_moment` cards
- `verse_overlay.text` and `verse_overlay.reference`
- `completion_verse.text`, `completion_verse.reference`
- `scripture_connections[].text` and `scripture_connections[].reference`
- `discovery_questions[].category` and `discovery_questions[].question`. **Trap:** the
  source file itself can ship this field untranslated (e.g. `"Honesty"`/`"Faith"`/
  `"Purpose"` left in English inside an ES source) — a critic sampling prose paragraphs
  won't catch it, since it's a short label field, not a sentence. Before delivery, check
  every `category` value in the *source* file against the target language too, not just
  against what you produced — if the source itself is wrong, fix the source's category
  values to match the pattern used by other published encounters (e.g. `zacchaeus`:
  `"Ser visto"` / `"Être vu"` / `"Being seen"`), not just your own output.
- `prayer.title` and `prayer.content`
- `meta.scripture_reference` → translate book name only
- `meta.tags` → natural target language slugs, **with full target-language accentuation**.
  **Trap:** it's easy to mechanically carry over the source language's own spelling
  (including any missing diacritics) instead of writing the tag correctly in the target
  language — this shipped once in both PT and FR for the same encounter (`ressurreicao`/
  `esperanca` instead of `ressurreição`/`espera​nça`; `resurrection`/`esperance` instead of
  `résurrection`/`espérance`), caught only when a second critic pass happened to compare
  tags against a sibling published encounter's tags. A critic sampling narrative prose
  will not catch this, since tags aren't prose — check `meta.tags` explicitly, one word
  at a time, against correct target-language spelling.
- `meta.character` → translate the character description (e.g. `The Gadarene demoniac` →
  `El endemoniado gadareno`). This field is easy to miss because it sits in `meta`
  alongside untranslated UI fields — it shipped untranslated in DE/HI/JA once, caught
  only on a second critic pass. Always check it explicitly.

### Never add or remove JSON keys.
Structure must be identical to the source file (ES for EN/PT/FR targets, EN for
JA/ZH/DE/AR/HI/FIL targets).

---

## Translation Quality Standards

**Register:** Cinematic, immersive, warm. These are narrative encounters — translate for emotional impact, not academic precision.

**Not literal:** Translate meaning and feel. Natural idioms in the target language are preferred.

**Narrative cards (`cinematic_scene`):** Keep the short, punchy sentence rhythm. Do not merge sentences.

**Prayer:** Natural spoken address to God — no academic language, no untranslated foreign terms.

**Cognates (FR, PT, ES):** Words identical or near-identical across languages (e.g. `Courage` in French, `Grâce`) are valid translations — do not change them. The validator may warn but these are correct.

---

## MANDATORY GATE: Per-Language Register Rules

Before delivering a translated file, check it against the rule for its language.
A translation can be grammatically fluent and still fail this gate — check anyway.

**Hindi (HI):** Jesus takes the respectful plural — verbs included, not just pronouns.
Example: ✗ "यीशु आया...उसने कहा" → ✓ "यीशु आए...उन्होंने कहा". Does not apply to quoted
verse fields (`verse_text`, `verse_overlay.text`, `completion_verse.text`,
`scripture_connections[].text`) — those follow the cited Bible version's own grammar.
**Trap:** this rule governs subject agreement only. In ने-ergative compound-verb
constructions ("X ने ... करने दिया/न दिया", "जिसे यीशु ने बदल दिया"), the verb agrees with
the direct object, not the subject — and when the object is postposition-marked (उसे,
जिसे, etc.) or absent, the verb defaults to masculine singular (दिया), never दिए. Applying
the respectful-plural rule here produces a real grammar error (यीशु ने ... दिए ✗), not a
register fix — this exact mistake shipped once and was only caught on a second review
pass. Always distinguish subject-agreement contexts from ने-ergative object-agreement
contexts before "fixing" a दिया/दिए-type verb near यीशु.

**Japanese (JA):** When Jesus (イエス) or God (神) is the subject, the verb must be in
honorific form (敬語), not plain form. Other characters (Mary, Peter, etc.) stay in
plain form — that's correct, don't flag it.

**Chinese (ZH):** Never use 您 for God/Jesus — always 你. Flag 您 as the error, not 你.

**Spanish / Portuguese / French (ES / PT / FR):** No hard gate — natural register per
house style. Cognates are valid (see above).

---

## Structural Rules

- `completion` card **must always be last** in the cards array
- `discovery_activation` card **must always be present**
- `has_interactive` in `index.json` must match whether the file contains an `interactive_moment` card — do not add or remove this card type

---

## Reading Time
`estimated_reading_minutes` is an **editorial value** — not a formula. Use the EN value as baseline.

| Language | Adjustment from EN |
|---|---|
| ES, PT, FR | +1-2 min |
| DE | +1 min |
| HI | +2 min |
| JA, ZH | +2-3 min |

Store the value in both the JSON file and `index.json`.

---

## Validation
Run after all languages are complete. Zero errors required before delivery.

```bash
# Run encounters validator
python3 encounters/encounters_scripts/validate_encounters.py

# Or via master
python3 encounters/encounters_scripts/encounters_master_validator.py
```

Warnings about cognates (FR/PT/ES) and reading time differences from EN are expected and acceptable. All other warnings must be investigated and resolved.

---

## MANDATORY: Native-Speaker Critic Review

`validate_encounters.py` checks schema and structure — it cannot catch bad prose. The
translating agent also cannot reliably catch its own register mistakes (this is exactly
how the HI plural-Jesus error shipped). So after each language file passes validation,
before delivery, spawn a **fresh subagent (NOT HAIKU model)** (no shared context with the translator) with
exactly this prompt, substituting the language, and nothing more:

> you are a native {language} speaker, read this file and tell me if you find: Typos /
> Grammar Errors, Awkward / Non-native-sounding phrasing take your time line by line,
> your comments in English. After complete the validation any error you find, search
> broader in the file to see if you have a repeat pattern to document and inform your
> findings.

Apply the fixes the critic finds, then re-run `validate_encounters.py` to confirm the
edits didn't break structure. Do this per language file — do not skip it for languages
that "usually don't have issues."

### MANDATORY GATE: Verify Every Critic Claim Before Applying

Critic subagents can hallucinate findings that read exactly like real ones — same tone,
same apparent specificity — so confidence and detail are not signals of correctness.
Before applying or reporting any finding, verify it independently of the critic's say-so:

1. **String-literal claims** (a typo, a specific broken phrase, "space before comma", a
   quoted sentence) — `grep` the file for the exact string the critic quotes. If it
   doesn't match, the finding is stale or fabricated: discard it, don't downgrade it to
   "minor."
2. **Count claims** ("N double spaces", "M occurrences of X") — verify with a script, not
   by eye, and check inside string *values* only. A naive search over a pretty-printed
   JSON file will match structural whitespace (indentation) and produce a large,
   meaningless number that has nothing to do with the prose.
3. **Grammar-rule claims** ("X is mandatory in this language") — confirm against a real
   reference before applying, especially when the claim would *add* something (a comma,
   a word, an article). A confidently-cited grammar rule can still be wrong or backwards;
   citing a rule is not the same as the rule being correct.
4. Only findings that survive verification get applied. When rejecting a finding, note
   briefly why (false / stylistic-not-error / rule cited incorrectly) so the reasoning
   doesn't have to be redone if the same finding resurfaces.

### MANDATORY GATE: Cross-Language Pattern Sweep

The same ES source sentence, translated independently into each target language, tends
to produce the *same shape* of mistranslation in every language it's rendered into,
because each translation pass mirrors the source's syntax rather than re-deriving the
idiom natively. A critic (or your own read) samples one language and one card — it does
not, by itself, tell you whether the identical bug is sitting untouched in the other
language files for this same encounter.

Do not let critic review narrow into a search for isolated, unrelated one-off errors.
When any finding turns out to be a *category* of mistake — a calqued idiom, an
agent/patient inversion, an ambiguous possessive, a mixed metaphor, a category-mismatch
verb (e.g. a visual verb applied to a sound) — treat it as evidence that the same
category may recur elsewhere, not as a single fix-and-move-on:

1. **Within the file**: grep/read for the same *shape* of error in every other card, not
   just the flagged line — a critic samples, it does not exhaustively cover.
2. **Across languages**: once a pattern is identified in one language file for this
   encounter, check whether the same underlying ES sentence/concept was mistranslated the
   same way in the other already-translated language files. Fixing it in one language but
   leaving the identical bug live in another because that file was "already reviewed"
   defeats the point of having noticed the pattern.
3. **Across encounters**: if a pattern shows up on more than one encounter, it belongs in
   this skill file as a named trap for future translation passes to check against
   proactively, not rediscovered fix-by-fix each time.

### MANDATORY GATE: Post-Fix Reverse Validation & Pattern Sweep

A grammar/style fix can silently break meaning — restructuring a clause to fix a case
error can turn "he walked toward danger with eyes open" into a circular sentence that no
longer says anything. The agent that applies the fix is the worst-positioned to notice
this (it's focused on the grammar, not re-deriving the theological point). So after
applying critic fixes and before reporting done:

1. **Re-read the complete file**, not just the diffed lines — meaning depends on
   surrounding context the diff view won't show you.
2. **For every edit made**, verify it still expresses the original point. Anchor the
   check against the card's paired Bible reference and its `revelation_key` — those are
   the source of truth for what the sentence is supposed to say. If a rewrite makes a
   sentence grammatically correct but tautological, vaguer, or logically disconnected
   from its `revelation_key`, it is a regression — fix it, don't wave it through.
3. **Scan the entire file for the same error pattern(s)** the critic just flagged —
   critic passes sample, they don't exhaustively cover. If the critic caught an
   anglicism, a dangling modifier, an aufstehen/auferstehen-type mistranslation, or a
   colon-capitalization slip in one card, grep/read for that same pattern in every other
   card before considering the round done.
4. **Validate JSON** after every batch of edits (`python3 -m json.tool <file>` or the
   project validator) — never leave this until the very end.

Repeat steps 2–4 until a full pass finds nothing new. Only then move to the next
language or report completion.

### ZH-Specific Check: 您/你 Register

For Chinese files only, after the critic review, grep the file for 您. This character
has no legitimate use in this content (no correct quoted-scripture use, no homograph) —
every hit is a real violation of the project rule (see "MANDATORY GATE: Per-Language
Register Rules" above) and should be replaced with 你.

---

## index.json Update
- Update the existing entry in the `encounters` array — do not duplicate or reorder
- Pull `titles`, `subtitles`, `scripture_reference` directly from each translation file
- `estimated_reading_minutes` must match each translation file exactly
- `status` — do not change `published` or `coming_soon`
- Run `validate_encounters.py` after updating to confirm no regressions

---
